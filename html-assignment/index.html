    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        
        Greetings, I'm Pranay, and I'm enrolled in the Interactive Media Designing course. 
        My goal is to acquire vast amounts of information and study several languages.
         I am studying this degree because I am more interested in photography,
          which has been my passion since grade 7. I am from India,
           so I am giving this field my all. I'm a lifelong learner who wants to expand her knowledge for the future so she can meet her needs.

            Whatever it is, I desire it. I'm trying my hardest to build my own website
